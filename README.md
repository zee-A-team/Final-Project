The purpose of this project is to illustrate the increase of animal-extinction rates during recent years.

When building this project, we found that there was no one data source that would fit our needs to create this application. We have created a custom database by hand-scraping various resources on the internet.

Our custom data-set is public and available through GraphQl.

##TO RUN LOCALLY:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
